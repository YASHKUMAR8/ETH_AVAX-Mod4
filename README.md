# DengenToken Smart Contract

## Overview

The `DengenToken` contract is an ERC20 token with additional features for redeeming tokens for various items and managing token balances. It extends the ERC20 standard provided by OpenZeppelin and includes functions for minting and burning tokens, redeeming items, and transferring tokens. The contract is owned by an administrator who has exclusive rights to mint new tokens.

## Features

- **Token Management**: Mint and burn tokens as required.
- **Redemption System**: Redeem tokens for items with predefined costs.
- **Balance Checking**: View token balances and redeemed items.
- **Transfer Functionality**: Transfer tokens between addresses.

## Contract Structure

- **ERC20 Token**: Implements the ERC20 standard.
- **Ownable**: Uses OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract to restrict certain actions to the contract owner.
- **Redemption**: Allows users to redeem tokens for items and keep track of redeemed items.

## Constructor

- Initializes the contract with predefined item costs.

## Functions

### Minting and Burning

- **`minttoken(address to, uint256 amount)`**: Mints new tokens to the specified address.
  - Parameters:
    - `to`: Address to receive the minted tokens.
    - `amount`: Number of tokens to mint.
  
- **`burntoken(uint256 amount)`**: Burns tokens from the sender's balance.
  - Parameters:
    - `amount`: Number of tokens to burn.

### Redemption

- **`redeemtoken(string memory itemName, uint256 amount)`**: Redeems tokens for a specified item.
  - Parameters:
    - `itemName`: Name of the item to redeem.
    - `amount`: Quantity of the item to redeem.

- **`togetRedeemedItems(address account)`**: Returns a list of redeemed items for a specified address.
  - Parameters:
    - `account`: Address to query for redeemed items.

- **`toprintRedeemedTokens(address account)`**: Returns a string representation of redeemed items for a specified address.
  - Parameters:
    - `account`: Address to query for redeemed items.

### Balance and Transfer

- **`check_Balance(address account)`**: Returns the token balance of a specified address.
  - Parameters:
    - `account`: Address to check the balance for.

- **`to_transferTokens(address from, address to, uint256 amount)`**: Transfers tokens from one address to another.
  - Parameters:
    - `from`: Address to transfer tokens from.
    - `to`: Address to transfer tokens to.
    - `amount`: Number of tokens to transfer.

## Item Costs

The following items can be redeemed, with their associated costs:

- **Pen**: 1 token
- **Book**: 2 tokens
- **Eraser**: 3 tokens
- **Scale**: 6 tokens

## Usage

1. **Deployment**: Deploy the contract on an Ethereum network (e.g., Ethereum mainnet, Ropsten, Rinkeby).
2. **Minting**: Use the `minttoken` function to mint tokens for users.
3. **Burning**: Users can burn tokens using the `burntoken` function.
4. **Redeeming**: Users can redeem tokens for items using the `redeemtoken` function.
5. **Checking Balances**: Use `check_Balance` to view token balances.
6. **Transferring Tokens**: Transfer tokens between addresses using the `to_transferTokens` function.

## Security

Ensure that only trusted parties interact with the contract and that the owner account is secure. Follow best practices for Ethereum smart contract security.
